                             <p>The sun was shining brightly. It was so bright that I can barely see anything, just the light confusing me whether I sleep or wake up. It feels like something was sucking out my soul from my body. It was strange yet beautiful…</p>
							<p>I woke up in a different room and I was not in my pajamas. The room was much bigger and elegant; the bed was queen-sized with white and yellow pastel sheets. The floor was covered with pale green floor mat designed with spiral patterns. The study table, lantern and shelves were all elegant. Even the lights added more vibrancy in the room.</p>
							<p> When I came in front of a full length mirror with wonderful floral carvings, it was only at that moment I looked to what I was wearing. I was wearing a green pastel umbrella-cut gown. It was slightly off shoulder and my hands were in gloves. My hair was neatly styled with a glittering head dress. I definitely looked like a princess from a damsel in distress into a beautiful and shining lady. But...</p>
							<p>Where am I?</p>
							<p>I turned and ran out to the door. It was strange, I’m certain that this place was completely unfamiliar to me. Yet, it feels like I’ve known this place for a long time since I was running from corner to corner until I reached the main door of the mansion. In that moment, I heard people screaming and shouting behind me. I continued running towards the field to the road. There was nobody, I can only hear my panting and heartbeats. I felt fear all over me; tears were falling from my eyes and my feet were chapped and hurt. But still, I did not stop running. It was as if someone is telling me not to stop but a lot of questions were flooding my mind.</p>
