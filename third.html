                            <p>Is oblivion a blessing to our soul? Did we happen to choose it? Or are we meant to receive it?</p>
							<p>A few days later, I asked my best friend where she got the man's portrait. She told me that the portrait was the artist himself. I don't know what I should feel by that time. Hope? Scared? My best friend did ask me if what's happening but I wasn't able to answer her instead I told her I am okay, that there's just things I need to attend to. I know she's beginning to notice my actions and that she's already getting worried about me. Still, she let me handle things on my own because she knows that this is not something she should get involve.</p>
							<p>My best friend gave me the address where the artist lives. It was quite far from the village I live. I drove for about 5 hours from the village to the village he's staying. After 10 minutes, my car is already at the other side of the road by his house. I got out of the car but I did not cross the road. I just stood looking at the house. It was a two-storey house and the gate was left open. I can see the wide front yard and I can feel the artistic atmosphere around the house. It looks simple but it says something else is more inside.</p>
							<p>I was still looking at the house and doubting if I should go there or not. Just then, a man went out of the house wearing an apron spilled with paints and he was carrying a blank canvas and the stand. A woman was behind him who’s holding paint brushes and oil paints. They were talking and he was smiling at her. Afterwards, the woman went back inside the house and came out with a glass of juice. She kissed his cheeks before she went back inside and closed the door.</p>
